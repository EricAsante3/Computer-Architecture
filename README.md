## **Repository Overview**  


### **1. Binary Search In Assembly**  
**Description:**  
This lab focuses on implementing the Binary Search algorithm using RISC-V assembly language.



### **2. Four-bit ALU**  
**Description:**  
This lab focuses on the design and implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit binary inputs.

### **3. RISC-V Processor Design Lab**  
**Description:**  
This lab focused on designing and implementing a simplified RISC-V processor. Topics include instruction set architecture (ISA), datapath design, and control unit implementation.
